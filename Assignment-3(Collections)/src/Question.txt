1) Write Java code to define List . Insert 5 floating point numbers in List, and using an iterator, find the sum of the numbers in List.

2) Given the following class
Employee class{ Double Age; Double Salary; String Name}
Design the class in such a way that the default sorting should work on firstname and lastname.

Also, Write a program to sort Employee objects based on salary using Comparator. 

3) Design a Data Structure SpecialStack that supports all the stack operations like push(), pop(), isEmpty(), isFull() and an additional operation getMin() which should return minimum element from the SpecialStack. (Expected complexity Â­ O(1))

4) Create class Employee with attributes name,age,designation and use instances of these class as keys in a Map and their salary as value
